# Corona In Bangladesh

This repository contains the  code for coronainbangladesh - a popular covid-19 dashboard and awareness website for Bangladesh. 

## Description

The project was created at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to raise awareness about COVID-19 and to provide accurate and up-to-date information about the state of the pandemic in Bangladesh. At the time, we felt that there was a information gap between the masses and official news sources, which inspired us to create this website. As this information gap has now been filled by authorataive sources, we beleive the project has served it's purpose and is no longer actively maintained. 

## Built With

- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for the backend
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [ejs](https://ejs.co/) for website layouts/design 
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for the database
- [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) (App Engine) for deployment. 


## Features

- Interactive and visual articles on COVID-19 and proper safety practises.
